# A simplified table highlighting the differences between prevention costs, appraisal costs, and failure costs:

| Aspect             | Prevention Costs               | Appraisal Costs                 | Failure Costs                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Costs to avoid defects.       | Costs to evaluate quality.     | Costs due to defects found.   |
| **Focus**          | Proactive measures to prevent issues. | Verifying and validating software quality. | Impact of defects after release. |
| **Examples**       | Training, code reviews, process improvements. | Testing, code inspections, audits. | Cost of fixing defects, customer support. |
| **Purpose**        | Reduce the likelihood of defects. | Identify defects early for timely corrections. | Highlight impact of poor quality. |

In summary, prevention costs aim to avoid defects, appraisal costs focus on evaluating quality, and failure costs result from defects found after release. By investing in prevention and appraisal, organizations can reduce the overall impact of failure costs on their software products.
