## The difference between white box and black box testing in Software Quality Assurance (SQA):

|            | White Box Testing                          | Black Box Testing                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition | Testing based on internal code knowledge | Testing without internal code knowledge               |
| Focus      | Internal structure and logic of the code | External behavior and functionality of the software   |
| Purpose    | To ensure code correctness and coverage  | To validate software against requirements and specs   |
| Testers    | Typically done by developers            | Performed by independent testers or QA team members  |
| Knowledge  | Requires access to the source code       | Requires no access to the source code                 |
| Techniques | Statement Coverage, Branch Coverage, etc. | Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, etc. |
| Advantages | Thorough testing, uncover hidden errors  | Independent of implementation, client perspective     |
| Disadvantages | Time-consuming, may not cover all scenarios | May not explore all paths in code, limited to available inputs |
