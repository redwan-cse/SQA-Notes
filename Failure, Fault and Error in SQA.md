# In software quality assurance (SQA), the following terms have different meanings:

i) Failure: A failure is the inability of a software system or component to perform its required functions within specified performance requirements. For example, a failure can occur when software crashes, freezes, or produces incorrect outputs.

ii) Fault: A fault is a defect in the software that causes it to deviate from its expected behavior. A fault can be introduced during the software lifecycle's development, testing, or maintenance phases. For example, a fault can be a logical error, a syntax error, or a design flaw.

iii) Error: An error is a human action that produces an incorrect or unexpected result. A developer, a tester, a user, or any other software stakeholder can make an error. For example, an error can be a misunderstanding of the requirements, a typo, or a wrong input.
