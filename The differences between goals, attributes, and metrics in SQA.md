# The differences between goals, attributes, and metrics in Software Quality Assurance (SQA):

| Aspect        | Goal                           | Attributes                       | Metrics                                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Definition    | Overall objective or purpose   | Specific characteristics         | Quantitative measurements to assess attributes  |
| Purpose       | Guides quality assurance       | Criteria for evaluating quality  | Provide data for quality evaluation and control |
| Focus         | High-level                    | Detailed                         | Measurable and specific                         |
| Example       | Develop a user-friendly app    | Usability, accessibility, etc.   | Response time, number of defects, etc.          |
| Role in SQA   | Sets direction and purpose    | Defines what to evaluate         | Provides data to track progress and improvements|

The goal establishes the general objective for SQA efforts, attributes define specific characteristics that need to be evaluated, and metrics provide quantitative measurements to assess those attributes during the software development and testing processes.
