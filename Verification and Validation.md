# A simplified comparison between **verification and validation** in Software Quality Assurance:

| Aspect         | **Verification **                            | **Validation  **                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Focus**      | Interim work products                    | Final product                      |
| **Timing**     | Throughout development process         | End of development process         |
| **Purpose**    | Check compliance with requirements    | Confirm user needs are met         |
| **Methods**    | Reviews, inspections, static analysis  | Testing, user feedback              |
| **Output**     | Early defect identification               | End-product suitability               |
| **Involvement**| QA teams, peers                             | End-users, stakeholders             |

Verification ensures the development process meets requirements, while validation ensures the final product meets user needs.
