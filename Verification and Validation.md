## A simplified comparison between **verification and validation** in Software Quality Assurance:


| Aspect         | Verification                              | Validation                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Checks if the process is followed correctly and the output meets standards and requirements. | Ensures the final product meets user needs and works as intended. |
| **Focus**      | Quality of intermediate work products during development. | Quality of the final product after development. |
| **Timing**     | Throughout the development process. | At the end of the development process. |
| **Purpose**    | Find and fix issues early in the process. | Confirm the product meets user expectations. |
| **Methods**    | Reviews, inspections, static analysis. | Testing and user feedback. |
| **Output**     | Early identification of defects. | Assurance of product usability. |
| **Involvement**| Done by peers or QA teams. | Involves end-users or stakeholders. |
| **Objective**  | Improve development process and compliance. | Ensure the product serves its intended purpose. |
