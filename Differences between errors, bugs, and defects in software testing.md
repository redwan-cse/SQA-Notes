| **What are they?** | Mistakes in development, like typos or logic mistakes. | Problems discovered during testing, causing the software to behave unexpectedly. | Issues found in the software that prevent it from working correctly. |
| **Who makes them?** | Made by developers during coding. | Can be introduced by developers or occur during testing. | Can be present at any stage, from development to production. |
| **When are they found?** | Detected during coding or early testing. | Found during testing but not always immediately fixed. | Identified during testing or after the software is released. |
| **Impact on software** | Can lead to the introduction of bugs or defects. | Affects specific functionality, causing unexpected behavior. | Causes malfunctions, crashes, or incorrect behavior. |
| **Responsibility** | Developers are responsible for fixing errors. | Development team fixes bugs reported by testers. | Development team addresses defects found during testing or production. |
| **Examples** | Typos, logic mistakes, or syntax errors. | Calculation errors, display issues, or security vulnerabilities. | Functional problems, crashes, or performance issues. |

I hope this simpler version helps clarify the distinctions between errors, bugs, and defects!
