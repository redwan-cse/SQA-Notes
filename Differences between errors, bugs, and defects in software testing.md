| Aspect           | Errors              | Bugs                  | Defects                  |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Definition**   | Mistakes made by developers during the development phase, e.g., logical or syntax errors. | Deviations from the specified requirements or expected behavior. | Any flaw or imperfection that prevents the software from functioning as intended. |
| **Occurrence**   | Introduced by humans, often during the coding phase. | Can be introduced during development or testing phases. | Can be present at any stage, including design, development, or integration. |
| **Detection**    | Usually detected and resolved by developers during code review or early testing. | Detected by testers during various testing phases (e.g., functional, integration, or system testing). | Detected by testers during testing or reported by users in the production environment. |
| **Impact**       | Can lead to the introduction of bugs or defects in the software. | Affects the functionality of the software and may cause failure in specific scenarios. | Can cause malfunctions, crashes, or incorrect behavior in the software. |
| **Origin**       | Arise from misunderstanding or oversight in the development process. | Can stem from errors made during development or from misinterpretation of requirements. | Can be a result of errors, bugs, or external factors affecting the software. |
| **Responsibility** | Developers are responsible for preventing and fixing errors. | Development team is responsible for fixing bugs reported by testers. | Development team is responsible for fixing defects found during testing or production. |
| **Timing**       | Detected and addressed during the development phase. | Discovered during testing but not necessarily immediately resolved. | Identified and fixed during the testing phase or after software release. |
| **Process Stage** | Typically addressed in the coding and unit testing phase. | Identified and reported during various testing stages. | Can be identified during any stage, including development, testing, or after release. |
| **Examples**     | Syntax errors, logic errors, algorithmic mistakes. | Incorrect calculations, data display issues, security vulnerabilities. | Functional issues, crashes, performance problems. |

Please note that the terms "bugs" and "defects" are often used interchangeably in the software development and testing industry, and their definitions may vary depending on the context. The table above provides a general differentiation between the terms, but keep in mind that in practice, their usage might not always strictly adhere to these distinctions.
